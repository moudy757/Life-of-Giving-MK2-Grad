# **Life of Giving**

A Simple WebApp for Charity.



**Introduction**

Helping others gives us a new perspective to life and keeps us from focusing on our own problems. Besides helping others, doing a good deed warms our own hearts and makes us feel good. By focusing more on others rather than ourselves, this is a reminder for the many people out there who are in more need for help than we are. Thus, charities offer individuals the opportunity to provide help to those who are in need. Mobile Web Applications present an easy way of reaching out to charities, thus this is this projectâ€™s topic. The act of charity itself is a social activity for those who may feel isolated and alone, it helps them be able to feel like they are contributing to the overall well-being of their communities. Most of the charities are included, whether they are known or unknown, big or small.

**The Problem**

The Egyptian charity community lacks in the aspect of online availability to the Egyptian population. 
In order for individuals to participate with charities, they have to reach out to them through calls, as there are no other methods of communication. Therefore, a charity web application will elevate the process of doing good deeds, as it will constantly allow Egyptians the opportunity of donating to the less fortunate due to the ease of access. 

**The Purpose**

The main purpose of a charity web application is for individuals to be able to donate whatever they can with a touch of a button from the comfort of their homes. In addition, it provides social benefits to the public, in the form of the relief of assisting people at times of need, especially those who are the victims of natural disasters, catastrophes, hunger, diseases or poverty. The application will help supply the less fortunate with food, medical aid and other fundamental needs.
